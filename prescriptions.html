				<p>Sometimes, these emails write themselves. Take last week—I was doing some research when I came across a statistic so shocking that I knew immediately I had to share it with you.</p>
				<p>In 2015, the most recent year available, Americans spent $457 billion on prescription medications. That's <i>billion</i>, with a "b" just on prescriptions alone.</p>
				<p>Now, if these were vital, life-saving prescriptions with no alternatives, I wouldn't be so up in arms. But many of these prescriptions were written for health concerns that we <u>know</u> can be dealt with naturally, without the need for prescription drugs. Which means a huge part of that <u>$457 billion</u> went into Big Pharma's pockets for no reason.</p>
				<p>It also explains why this email was so important-and easy-to write—because you deserve to know about these natural treatments for some of the most common health concerns:</p>
				<p><b><i>Acid reflux or Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): Licorice.</i></b> If you have GERD, then you know that acid reflux is more than just heartburn. Simply drinking a glass of milk isn't going to cut it. However, you don't have to resort to prescriptions either. Numerous studies have shown licorice can ease acid reflux symptoms by increasing the mucous that coats and protects your esophagus. Too much plain licorice can cause other health problems, however, because of a compound called <i>glycyrrhizin</i>. So when choosing a licorice supplement, choose one that's had the glycyrrhizin removed. Look for DGL, or deglycyrrhizinated licorice, on the label.</p>
				<p><b><i>High blood pressure: Potassium, Magnesium, and CoQ10.</i></b> These three nutrients have been linked to dramatically lower blood pressure levels, even in people with very high numbers. You'll find them in foods like bananas, broccoli, and organic grass-fed beef. However, given the amounts you need—500mg/day of potassium, 200 mg/day of magnesium, and 200 mg/day of CoQ10—you may need high quality supplements.</p>
				<p><b><i>High blood sugar: Ginger.</i></b> In small but well-designed studies, ginger was shown to reduce fasting blood sugar levels as well as A1c levels. Just as importantly, ginger may help protect your body against damage that can be caused by living with high blood sugar for too long. Enjoy ginger raw, cooked, or brewed into tea.</p>
				<p><b><i>Insomnia: Melatonin or Valerian.</i></b> A reported 60% of Americans struggle with sleeplessness. If you're one of them, don't worry that you have to stare at the ceiling or take an addictive prescription! You have natural options in melatonin and valerian. Melatonin is a hormone your body produces naturally. It's actually triggered by darkness, and tells your body it's time to sleep. However, it can interfere with some medications, so ask your doctor or pharmacist before taking it. If you need another alternative, try valerian. It's believed to increase levels of GABA, a chemical that helps calm and soothe you so you can drift off to sleep.</p>
				<p><b><i>Male performance issues: Ashwaganda.</i></b> The little blue pill may have a great marketing team, but that doesn't guarantee it's the best option for you. There are numerous natural treatments for performance issues, but one of the best has to be ashwaganda. This herb has been treasured by men for centuries, and for good reason. It increases testosterone, so you get a physical boost, but it also helps out mentally. It's been shown to relieve anxiety and stress, by lowering levels of the stress hormone, cortisol. When taken along with exercise, it may even help build muscle and strength so you've got the power to go all night.</p>
