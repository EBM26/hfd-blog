				<p>When I was a little girl, my mother kept an aloe plant on her kitchen window sill. Any time someone got a slight burn in the kitchen, or from being in the sun too long, she'd cut a leaf and slather the sore spot with fresh gel. Once I became a mother, I did the same thing in my kitchen for my kids. </p>
				<p>It turns out that burns aren't the only time you should reach for the aloe vera, because it has so many more uses than just soothing skin. From younger looking skin, to a healthier blood sugar levels, there are lots of reasons to keep aloe vera close at hand.</p>
				<p class="font20 bold">Topical Applications</p>
				<p>The easiest, and most well-known way to use aloe vera is topically. Simply buy a plant to keep in the house, or pick up 100% pure aloe vera gel from a reputable health food store. If you go this route, make sure you're getting 100% aloe vera. Sadly, many manufacturers are adding fillers, so you're spending money on gels that won't help!</p>
				<p><i><b>Skin care:</b></i> Aloe is great for your skin, even when you don't have a burn! It contains powerful antioxidants to fight the free radicals that cause premature aging. Just as importantly, it's antibacterial, so it can help get your skin deep down clean, which keeps it clear and healthy looking. Finally, it's an effective, all-natural moisturizer, so your skin stays hydrated and supple.</p>
				<p><i><b>Hair care:</b></i> From dry, over-styled hair to unattractive dandruff and itchy scalp, aloe vera can be your hair care solution. To infuse dry hair with moisture, work the gel through the length of your strands, cover with a shower cap, and let sit for at least 15 minutes before washing your hair as usual. To address dandruff and an itchy scalp, add gel to your regular conditioner, being sure to massage it into your scalp, as well as your hair. </p>
				<p><i><b>Oral care:</b></i> For fresher breath and a cleaner mouth, look no further than aloe vera. It's antiseptic, antifungal, <u>and</u> blocks plaque build-up, for a clean, healthy mouth. Either rinse with aloe vera liquid, or add gel to your toothpaste and brush normally. Also, if you get cold sores, apply gel directly to the sore for faster healing.</p>
				<p class="font20 bold">Consuming Aloe Vera</p>
				<p>Although topical applications are the best known ways to use aloe vera, they're far from the most impressive. You can also eat, drink, or swallow aloe vera for some truly amazing health benefits. Some people find the gel from an aloe plant unpleasant because of its texture, so you can mix it with water or juice to make it easier to take. Or you can buy food-quality aloe vera liquid, extract, or capsules from your favorite market. Be sure to talk to your doctor about including aloe vera in your healthcare routine.</p>
				<p>Blood sugar support: At least two different studies have indicated that just two tablespoons of aloe vera juice or pulp extract per day can help lower blood sugar levels. In fact, it seems to work so well that people taking medications for blood sugar need to be diligent about keeping track of their numbers to ensure glucose levels don't drop too low.</p>
				<p>Heart health support: You know the markers of heart health—cholesterol, blood pressure, triglycerides… Well, several major studies have linked aloe vera to healthier measurements of all these markers, and more. Aloe vera has been associated with lower LDL, or “bad” cholesterol numbers, higher HDL, or “good” cholesterol numbers, better triglyceride levels, healthier blood pressure, and even more stable heart rhythm. Research indicates two teaspoons, or 10mL, of aloe vera juice or liquid for 12 weeks may result in significant improvement in heart health.</p>
				<p>My mother taught me about aloe vera for burns. Now I've taught my kids—and my mom—that there's much more to this succulent plant than we knew about all those years ago. Give it a try. Aloe vera's sure to become a tradition in your house, too.</p>
