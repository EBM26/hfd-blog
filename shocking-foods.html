				<p>When it comes to eating healthy, most people put food into two categories: healthy and unhealthy. </p>
				<p>Unfortunately, it's far too easy to put foods in the wrong category. Fads come and go, but we don't make the adjustment. Or researchers learn more information, but we don't get word. Or maybe, we're just given bad information from people who were misinformed themselves. It all happens. But when it does happen, you can miss out on some delicious, and nutritious, foods!</p>
				<p>Make sure that you aren't cheating yourself out of these six foods that are even healthier than you thought:</p>
				<ol class="number-list">
					<li><i><b>Beef</b></i>. Red meat has gotten a bad rap recently, and truthfully, it can be well-deserved. So what's beef doing on this list? You can keep beef in a healthy diet, so long as you make smart choices about it. Just like you are what you eat, cows are what they eat. So, if the source of your red meat was fed grains and given unnecessary antibiotics, that's going to show up in your steak. However, if your beef was grass-fed without hormones or antibiotics, the cow is healthier, and so is your steak. This isn't just theory, either. According to the latest research, organic, grass-fed beef may have less total fat, more omega-3s, more antioxidants, could help prevent heart disease, and more. Studies are early yet, but the results so far are definitely encouraging!</li>
					<li><i><b>Celery</b></i>. Long considered “diet food” people don't think about celery has having many health benefits beyond being a low-calorie snack you can eat a lot of without gaining weight. But it's so much more than that! New research has linked celery to heart health, liver health, and urinary tract health. It's also being studied as an anti-inflammatory cancer fighter. And yes, it's very low in calories, so you can snack without any guilt.</li>
					<li><i><b>Chicken thighs.</b></i> Back when low-fat diets were all the rage, chicken breasts took center stage and have stayed there ever since. Except many people think chicken thighs are juicier and more flavorful. If you're one of those people, you're going to love this:  The fat in chicken thighs includes mono-unsaturated fats, the healthy kind you want in your diet. Plus, dark meat is more nutritious overall, providing necessary vitamins and minerals that white meat doesn't.</li>
					<li><i><b>Coffee</b></i>. Your morning cup of coffee does a lot more than just wake you up, so don't feel guilty about drinking it! Coffee is loaded with antioxidants that protect against oxidative damage, and that's just the beginning. Research indicates it can help protect against several serious health conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, depression, Parkinson's disease, and even some cancers. The key is to not load up your coffee with so much sugar and creamer that it's no longer recognizable as coffee. Coffee-flavored sugary drinks aren't healthy. Coffee is.</li>
					<li><i><b>Eggs</b></i>. Eggs have been on many people's “unhealthy” list for years because of their high cholesterol levels, but studies have shown that they don't actually raise LDL, or “bad” cholesterol after all. In fact, eggs are associated with higher levels of HDL, or “good” cholesterol. Which is especially good news, because they're one of the most nutritious foods around and the nutrients found in eggs can help protect your immune system, your vision, your brain, and more.</li>
					<li><i><b>Romaine lettuce</b></i>. Often overshadowed by darker leafy greens like kale and spinach, some people have stopped eating romaine altogether. It's time to bring it back to the table, though, because romaine packs quite a nutritional punch. One cup of romaine contains measurable amounts of more than 35 essential nutrients and amino acids that work to keep you healthy. Romaine keeps your bones, heart, and immune system strong. It has impressive anti-aging properties. And of course, like any leafy green, can do wonders for your digestive tract.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>There's no need to miss out on all this nutrition-or flavor! Go ahead and start working these foods back into your diet today.</p>
