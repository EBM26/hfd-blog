				<p>When your joints hurt, it can seem like managing your pain is a full-time job. You have to stop to rub, slow down, ice, shift…It's hard to know what to do, or how to help, but you know you can't just sit there!</p>
				<p>You're getting your 30 minutes a day of aerobic exercise and that's important. Your joints need that walk or swim as much as the rest of you does. But when it comes to really relieving joint pain, there are two other types of exercise you need to incorporate into your daily routine, too—strength training and range of motion.</p>
				<p>But you're already giving up at least 30 minutes of your day to exercise! How much more time are you supposed to commit to working out? Here's the good news—you can do the exercises you need to relieve joint pain in 10 minutes. That's it.</p>
				<p>They don't even have to be 10 consecutive minutes. You can break these exercises up if you want. The key is to do them. Regardless if you take 10 straight minutes, or do them 1 or 2 minutes at a time, your joints will thank you. Double check with your doctor about adding additional exercises, and then get to work at relieving pain!</p>
				<p class="font20 bold">Strong Muscles Mean Strong Joints</p>
				<p>Your muscles support your joints, so the stronger the muscles, the less strain there is on the joints. And the less strain on the joints, the less pain you'll feel.</p>
				<p><i>Elbows, Shoulders, and Wrists</i> — Good old bicep and tricep curls are great for easing pain in your arms. Start with 1-pound weights, or even no weight at all. Perform each exercise 10 times for each arm.</p>
				<p><i>Hips and Thighs</i> — March in place, bringing each knee up as high as you can. The goal here is height and control, not speed, so don't worry about how fast you're marching. Keep stepping for 60 seconds.  Be sure to stand next to a wall or chair, in case you lose your balance.</p>
				<p><i>Knees</i> — For this, you'll need a rubber ball the size of a basketball. Sit with your feet flat on the floor and the ball between your knees. Squeeze the ball for 5 seconds, then release. You should feel it in your inner thigh. Repeat 10 times. Don't have a rubber ball? That's okay. Sit with your feet flat, then straighten your leg until it is parallel to the floor. Be sure not to hyper-extend the knee! Hold for 5–10 seconds, then release. Repeat 10 times, each leg.</p>
				<p class="font20 bold">Stay Smooth, Not Stiff</p>
				<p>Range of motion and flexibility exercises can help prevent the stiffness and "locked" feeling that can be so painful. These are best done when your muscles are warm, so consider finishing up your daily aerobic exercise with these.</p>
				<p><i>Cow</i> — Start on your hands and knees. Your hands should be under your shoulders, and your knees hip width apart. Slowly curve your back, so that your chest comes up and your shoulders go back. Think about trying to get your spine through to the floor. Your shoulders, back, and hips should form a "U" shape. Hold for 5–10 seconds, then relax. Repeat 10 times.</p>
				<p><i>Cat</i> — This is the opposite of cow. Still on your hands and knees, arch your back, tucking your hips and shoulders in as far as they can go without lifting your knees or hands. Hold for 5–10 seconds, then relax. Repeat 10 times.</p>
				<p><i>Torso twist</i> — Lie on your back, arms extended, legs out straight. Keeping your hips on the floor, bring your knees to your chest. Lower both knees towards the floor to your left side. Do not force them. If your left knee doesn't touch the floor, that's okay! Look to your left, as well. Hold for 10 seconds. Return to center, and lower your legs to the right side, looking to the right as well. Hold for 10 seconds and return. Repeat rotation 5–10 times.</p>
				<p>Managing your joint pain doesn't have to be a full-time job any longer! Now, you can both prevent and get relief in just 10 minutes a day.</p>
