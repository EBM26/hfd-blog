				<p>Everybody talk about heart health. And joint health. And brain health. And especially overall health. You know what no one talks about? Bladder health. </p>
				<p>Don’t get us wrong, we understand why. No one likes to talk about going to the bathroom. But if you’ve ever had a single UTI, bladder infection, or embarrassing leak or accident, you know it’s better to talk about improving bladder health early, before it becomes a long-term issue.</p>
				<p>There are some easy ways to keep your bladder healthy, so you don’t have to keep talking about it.  Here are some of our favorites:</p>
				<ol class="number-list">
					<li><i><b>Learn to do Kegels</b></i>. These exercises strengthen the pelvic floor which, in turn, helps support the nerves and muscles of your bladder. And they’re not just for women, either! Men’s bladders can benefit from Kegels, too. Ask your doctor how to do them correctly, so you’re getting the results you want.</li>
					<li><i><b>Drink cranberry juice</b></i>. This classic way to keep your bladder healthy works on a couple of levels. First, cranberry is a powerful antioxidant that fight back against the oxidative stress that damages your entire body, including your bladder. But then the acidity in the cranberry juice reacts with the bacteria that cause UTIs, so they don’t get a chance to dig in and make you sick. The key is to drink 100% cranberry juice, though. No sugar added, and no juice cocktails. If you can’t quite take the taste, cranberry supplements work, as well.</li>
					<li><i><b>Maintain a healthy weight</b></i>. If you need to lose a little weight, do so. The heavier you are the more strain and pressure you’re putting on your bladder.</li>
					<li><i><b>Get enough to drink—just not too much</b></i>. Dehydration is bad for your bladder, so make sure you’re getting your 8 glasses of 8 ounces a day. But be careful not to overload your bladder, either. That can cause urgency and leaks.</li>
					<li><i><b>Empty your bladder completely, every time</b></i>. Stopping mid-stream can pull bacteria back into your bladder. That’s just asking for an infection of some kind.</li>
					<li><i><b>Limit drinking when you need to</b></i>. Even though it’s important to get enough to drink, having to hold it too long should be avoided as well. If you know you’re going to be in the car for a long time without access to a rest stop, or don’t want to leave the movie, limit how much you drink beforehand. Pay special attention before bed. If your bladder is waking you every night, try to stop drinking at least 2 hours before bedtime.</li>
					<li><i><b>Move during the day</b></i>. Being sedentary throughout the day can cause fluid retention in your legs. At night, that fluid has to go somewhere, and that somewhere is your bladder. Avoid having to choose between getting up during the night and having to hold it by making sure you get enough activity during the day.</li>
					<li><i><b>Be careful during sex</b></i>. This one’s for the women. Going to the bathroom before and after sex can help flush bacteria away from your bladder. Also, make sure your partner washes their hands before you get too hot and heavy.</li>
					<li><i><b>Stay healthy in general</b></i>. If it’s good for your overall health, it’s going to be good for your bladder’s health, as well. </li>
					<li><i><b>Look into supplements</b></i>. While there are prescription drugs available that can control an unpredictable bladder, they often come with unpleasant side effects.  There are also natural supplements available, like Better Bladder, which can help promote and support your bladder health.</li>
