				<h1>5 Health-Saving Teas: A Complete Guide</h1>
				<p class="author">By <span class="author-title">Nicole Trelour, ND</span> - June 23, 2017</p>

				</div>
				<p>When I was a little girl, I would sit at the table with my mother and grandmother while they had their afternoon cup of tea. Even then, there was something relaxing about watching the whole process as one of them would heat the kettle, choose the tea leaves, and wait oh so patiently for the tea to steep until finally it was ready to pour and drink.</p>
				<p>One day when I was a teenager, a third cup appeared on the table, seemingly by magic, and I knew I was old enough to join them in tea and conversation. It's a tradition that continued for years. To this day, I like to take time to brew myself a cup of tea every day. </p>
				<p>As it turns out, my mother and grandmother were giving me a whole lot more than just a peaceful moment or two in the middle of the day. That daily cup of tea has far more health benefits than I think they ever realized, regardless of which tea is on the table.</p>
				<p><i>If you drink black tea</i> - This is the kind of tea most people think of when they think about tea. Orange pekoe, English breakfast, and earl grey are some of the more popular types of black tea. Numerous studies have linked black teas to heart health and improved markers associated with a healthy heart, such as cholesterol and triglycerides. Black tea may protect against several types of cancers, including lung cancer-even in smokers!</p>
				<p><i>If you drink chamomile tea</i> - Tea made from this little flower is loaded with antioxidants, so it takes on the free radicals that cause oxidative damage. Just as importantly, chamomile tea is an anti-inflammatory, so it can help reduce the systemic inflammation that can wreak havoc with your health. Plus, it makes for the perfect way to end the day, thanks to its calming effects that help reduce stress, anxiety, and depression.</p>
				<p><i>If you drink dandelion tea</i> - You're really missing out if you think dandelions are just weeds! Dandelion tea has 10% of the recommended daily allowance of calcium for strong bones and muscle health. Speaking of strong bones, dandelion tea is also an excellent source of vitamin K, a lesser known but equally important nutrient when it comes to keeping your bones healthy.</p>
				<p><i>If you drink green tea</i> - Perhaps the most respected and widely studied tea, green tea is considered the healthiest of teas for several reasons. First, it stunts the growth of several types of cancer. It protects the brain and the heart, lowers cholesterol levels, helps keep eyesight sharp, and more. The list of health benefits of green tea just goes on and on. </p>
				<p><i>If you drink oolong tea</i> - Most people were first introduced to oolong at their local Chinese restaurant, but it's worth bringing home. Early testing has shown positive results when it comes to lowering cholesterol, and it can help slow hardening of the arteries, as well. And according to the National Cancer Institute, it may help slow or reduce the risk of cancer.</p>
				<p>The most amazing part? These are just a small sample of the health benefits these teas bring to your table.</p>
				<p>My mother and grandmother probably didn't know how healthy it was when they taught me to drink tea. Regardless, I'm grateful for the memories-and the health benefits!</p>
