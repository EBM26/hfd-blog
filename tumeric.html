				<p>Years ago, I had the opportunity to travel and study throughout India, and fell in love with the culture, the people, and especially the food. One spice in particular, turmeric, added a depth of flavor to the dishes that made my taste buds sing-and turned my fingertips yellow!</p>
				<p>Back in the States, very few people had ever heard of turmeric, let alone eaten it, so it was far too long before I was able to experience its flavor again. However, times have changed and more people than ever are familiar with how delicious turmeric is, but do you know it's also <u>healthy</u>? As it turns out, turmeric-or more specifically, curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric-helps with a host of health issues!</p>
				<ol class="number-list">
					<li><b><i>Acts as an anti-inflammatory:</i></b> Some professionals have gone as far as to call curcumin the most effective anti-inflammatory in the world. I'm not sure I'm willing to go that far (yet), but it certainly is powerful. Research has indicated it's more effective than some anti-inflammatory medications, without the side effects of NSAIDs. Studies on its anti-inflammatory properties show it helps ease symptoms of arthritis, Crohn's disease, and other inflammation-related illnesses.</li>
					<li><b><i>Boosts antioxidant power:</i></b> You know how important antioxidants are to reversing and repairing oxidative damage caused by free radicals. Well, not only is curcumin a free radical scavenger in its own right, but it takes the efficacy of <u>other</u> antioxidants to the next level. Curcumin actually makes the other antioxidants in your body work harder and more efficiently.</li>
					<li><b><i>Fights cancer</i></b>. Several studies have shown curcumin can slow the growth of cancer cells, reduce the spread of cancer, and help kill off cancer cells. Perhaps even more importantly, early studies indicate curcumin may stop cancer from ever developing.</li>
					<li><b><i>Protects your brain</i></b>. You need a hormone known as Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor, or BDNF, in order to keep your brain healthy. When you're young, that's not a problem. Unfortunately, levels of BDNF tend to drop off as we age-and several diseases from depression to dementia have been linked to low levels of BDNF. However, there's good news! Curcumin has been shown to increase BDNF levels in the brain, slowing and even reversing some of the results of decreasing BDNF.</li>
					<li><b><i>Helps manage type 2 diabetes</i></b>. What exactly does "helps manage" mean? Well, one study showed curcumin to be 400 times more helpful at controlling diabetes than a popular prescription drug. Still, high blood sugar is only one aspect of diabetes. It can also cause complications that are just as detrimental to your health as the original disease! But curcumin helps reduce and control many of those complications, including diabetes-induced blindness.</li>
					<p>Times have changed. You don't have to travel to India to discover how delicious-or healthy-the curcumin in turmeric is any longer. So start reaping its health benefits today! </p>
