				<p>The other day, a friend of mine and I were chatting and she mentioned that her knees had started to creak a bit, so she'd started taking the popular joint supplements  glucosamine and chondroitin about 6 months ago. Unfortunately, while her knees weren't getting any worse, they weren't really getting any better either.</p>
				<p>When I asked her what other supplements she was taking along with the glucosamine and chondroitin, she looked shocked, as if she had no idea there were other supplements that were good for joint pain. On the one hand, I understood my friend's reaction. Most of the joint health marketing is around glucosamine and chondroitin. On the other hand, though, I'm glad she said something because those two supplements are <u>not</u> the only ones available for joint health...</p>
				<p class="font20 bold">Why Glucosamine Alone Doesn't Always Work</p>
				<p>Your body makes glucosamine, naturally, and uses it to form cartilage, the "cushion" in your joints. Unfortunately, production of glucosamine can slow down as you age. Combine this natural slow-down with the wear and tear that comes from using your joints for decades, and the cartilage in your joints can begin to weaken and erode.</p>
				<p>Taking glucosamine supplements can do wonders to protect against this loss of cartilage. When combined with chondroitin, glucosamine supplements can work even better than when they're taken alone. Since lack of glucosamine is such a common cause of joint stiffness and discomfort, glucosamine supplements tend to be the first places people start.</p>
				<p>However, if cartilage breakdown and lack of glucosamine isn't the cause of your joint discomfort, then adding glucosamine isn't going to help you feel better. Sure, it may help protect against future damage, but the achiness that's bothering you right now? Well, if glucosamine isn't the problem, it can't be the solution. That's where these supplements come in handy:</p>
				<ol class="number-list">
					<li><i><b>Boswellia serrata:</b></i> You may not think you've heard of boswellia, but you probably <u>have</u> heard of it by its other name, frankincense. The compounds in boswellia are natural anti-inflammatories, to help reduce swelling and ease stiffness. According to the Arthritis Foundation, it may help protect cartilage, as well.</li>
					<li><i><b>Boron:</b></i> Boron's been known to help with joint health since it was first studied back in 1963. Since then, the evidence has just continued to grow. Low levels of boron have been linked to lower levels of synovial fluid (the "lubrication" in your joints), weaker bones, and higher rates of arthritis. </li>
					<li><i><b>Bromelain:</b></i> This pineapple extract is gaining quite a reputation when it comes to joint health. It's a natural anti-inflammatory, which means it works similarly to over-the-counter NSAIDs, just without the scary side effects. Taking bromelain may also help improve mobility and relieve stiffness.</li>
					<li><i><b>Collagen II:</b></i> The same protein that keeps your skin plump and young-looking keeps your joints healthy and young-feeling, too! Of the 16 different types of collagen, collagen type II plays the largest role in maintaining joint health. In numerous human studies, collagen II has been shown to ease stiffness, erase aches, and even delay joint health deterioration—sometimes even better than glucosamine!</li>
					<li><i><b>MSM:</b></i> Its full name is methylsulfonylmethane, which is exactly why it's known as MSM. This compound helps with joint health in three ways. First, it supplies the body with sulfur, a key component of healthy joints. Then it's also an anti-inflammatory <u>and</u> an antioxidant, so it can help reduce swelling while fighting the free radicals that can do even more damage.</li>
					<li><i><b>Turmeric:</b></i> This bright yellow spice is a delicious addition to Indian dishes, but it's the active ingredient in it, curcumin, that helps with your joint discomfort. Several studies have linked turmeric and its curcumin to healthier joints, fewer aches, and greater mobility.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>So am I saying you shouldn't take glucosamine and chondroitin? Not at all! In fact, I'm a fan of both. I'm just saying they may not be the only supplements you need. Talk to your doctor about glucosamine, absolutely—and then talk to him about these natural solutions for joint health, as well!</p>
