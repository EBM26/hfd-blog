				<p>Some days, it hits after a meal. Other nights, it waits until you're asleep before kicking in and waking you up. It's the burning pain of gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. For years, doctors and the FDA told us that proton pump inhibitors, PPIs, were safe ways to soothe and prevent the worst symptoms of GERD. So people popped purple pills and, in fairness, felt better. Maybe you were one of them.</p>
				<p>Only recently, the FDA has changed its stance on both prescription and over-the-counter PPIs, and has announced they aren't nearly as safe as we were led to believe. Chronic use of PPIs can create a reliance on them, so that your symptoms get worse when you try to stop taking them-but that's not all. PPIs contribute to bone fractures, pneumonia, and even life-threatening arrhythmias.</p>
				<p>In light of all this, it's more important than ever to find effective, natural ways to relieve the symptoms of GERD:</p>
				<ol class="number-list">
					<li><i><b>Take aloe juice</b></i>. The anti-inflammatory action that helps ease sunburn can help ease heartburn, too! You can drink ½ cup of aloe juice straight, but some people have an issue with the gelatinous texture. If you can't quite manage aloe juice on its own, mixing that same half cup with a glass of water will help thin out the aloe without changing its effects. Do be warned that aloe is also a highly effective laxative, so you probably want to skip harvesting the juice from your plant. Instead, pick up "decolorized" aloe juice from the store. It's had the natural laxative removed.</li>
					<li><i><b>Try baking soda</b></i>. Since baking soda is what's known as a base, it neutralizes stomach acid, making it a traditional treatment with sound scientific backing. Relieve occasional heartburn by mixing ½ -1 tablespoon of baking soda with water and drinking it down. Only use it occasionally, though, because baking soda is high in sodium, so it can cause other side effects like swelling, nausea, and elevated blood pressure.</li>
					<li><i><b>Chew gum</b></i>. A study published in the Journal of Dental Research has linked chewing sugar-free gum thirty minutes after eating with less severe symptoms of GERD. It's believed that the gum helps increase saliva production which, in turn, helps rinse away and water down the acid in your stomach and esophagus faster. Now, normally I don't recommend using sugar-free products, but in this case, I'll make an exception. A single stick of gum every now and then isn't going to be nearly as unhealthy as taking PPIs!</li>
					<li><i><b>Drink ginger tea</b></i>. You may know ginger is good for nausea, but it can help soothe heartburn, too. Simply grate fresh ginger into boiling water and let steep for twenty to thirty minutes. Then drink it hot or cold, whichever you prefer.</li>
					<li><i><b>Go traditional, with slippery elm</b></i>. Although research is limited, what we know about slippery elm and GERD is promising. The University of Maryland Medical Center reports many people find heartburn and GERD relief from this traditional treatment. Combine two tablespoons of powdered slippery elm bark with two cups of boiling water. Let steep for three to five minutes. Drink it up to three times per day, as needed.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Don't suffer from GERD, or even just heartburn. And don't make yourself sicker trying to feel better. Use these all-natural ways to relieve the burn and stay healthy!</p>
