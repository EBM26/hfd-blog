				<p>Let's be honest, we all know what we're supposed to eat: protein, fiber, healthy fats, vitamins, minerals, and nutrients. <u>Knowing</u> how we're supposed to eat and <u>actually</u> eating that way are two different things, though, especially if you're trying to get all the nutrition your body needs without going overboard with calories.</p>
				<p>It's easy to feel like you either have to eat the same super foods day after day—and I don't care how much you love kale, eventually, it's going to get old—or you have to eat huge amounts of a variety of foods to ensure  your hitting the recommended daily nutrients.</p>
				<p>Well, I have good news for you. Eating the same boring foods day after day, or sacrificing nutrition to control calories are things of the past. All you need is two tablespoons of one super food in order to get huge health and nutritional benefits, for less than 150 calories.</p>
				<p>What is this amazing food? Simple—it's chia seed. And by sprinkling two tablespoons into your morning smoothie, over your oatmeal, or into a salad, you can get...</p>
				<p><b>Powerful antioxidants:</b> While chia seeds have been respected free radical scavengers for a while, new research indicates they may be even more powerful than previously understood. A recent study showed chia could prevent up to 70% of free radical damage and oxidative stress. This means chia is healthy and helpful for everything from younger looking skin to countering heart disease. </p>
				<p><b>Heart protection:</b> Antioxidant power isn't the only way chia can help protect your heart. They may help lower LDL cholesterol, the "bad" kind, while raising HDL cholesterol, the "goo" kind, as well as lowering triglyceride levels, too.</p>
				<p><b>Blood sugar stability:</b> You can thank the high levels of fiber in chia seed for this one. Diets high in fiber are associated with healthier, more stable blood sugar levels. Since two tablespoons of chia has 11 grams of fiber, you're definitely getting some bang for your buck.</p>
				<p><b>Bone health:</b> You know your bones need calcium, but they also need phosphorus, manganese, and protein, as well. The two tablespoons of chia we're talking about have 4 grams of protein, 18% of your daily calcium, 27% of your phosphorus, and 30% of your manganese! Don't forget, this all makes chia good for your teeth, as well.</p>
				<p><b>Cancer fighters:</b> In 2013, the <i>Journal of Molecular Biochemistry</i> reported that a specific omega-3 fatty acid, ALA, could reduce breast and cervical cancer cells, and most importantly, kill them without harming the healthy cells surrounding the cancerous ones. And you guessed it—chia seeds are an excellent source of ALA.</p>
				<p><b>A weight loss boost:</b> Chia may help you lose weight in three different ways. First, by giving you the energy to get through your workouts. Studies compared chia to highly processed, sugary energy drinks and discovered the seeds work just as well at keeping athletes energized. Chia has also been shown to help speed up metabolism, and target dangerous, stubborn belly fat. Finally, chia's fiber and protein keep you feeling fuller, longer, so that you can make smarter dietary choices.</p>
				<p><b>Prebiotics:</b> You've probably heard about probiotics, the good bacteria your gut needs to keep you healthy, but may not have heard about prebiotics. Think about prebiotics as probiotic food. You eat probiotics to stay healthy, and probiotics eat prebiotics for the same reason. Which makes eating prebiotics almost as important as eating probiotics.</p>
				<p>No wonder chia seeds are developing a reputation as one of the best super foods available. Keep chia seeds front and center in your pantry and you'll find ways to enjoy their nutty flavor in some of your favorite dishes. It's an easy way to meet your nutritional needs and delight your taste buds, all at once.</p>
