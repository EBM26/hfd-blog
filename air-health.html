				<h1>Is Your Home Making You Sick?</h1>
				<p class="author">By <span class="author-title">Bill Lewis</span> - March 23, 2018</p>
				<h2 class="font23">According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), your <i>indoor</i> air could be up to <span class="red">100 times more polluted</span> than <i>outdoor</i> air. </h2>
				<p>That's right...100 times!</p>
				<p>We are not talking about China or India.</p>
				<p>We are talking about right here in the United States.</p>
				<p>These hidden toxins and pollutants could be seeping, undetected, into your home through your walls, your furniture, your carpeting and your drapes.</p>
				<p>Not only that, you could <u>also</u> be inadvertently introducing even <i>more</i> toxins into your home, every day, without even realizing it.</p>
				<p>This includes basic things you do each and every day. Like cooking meals or cleaning your house.</p>
				<p>And that doesn't even include common airborne toxins like mold, pet dander, pollen...even germs and viruses...all floating blissfully through the air – just waiting to be sucked into the lungs of both you and your loved ones.</p>
				<div class="post-image-div">

					<p class="caption">We face outdoor and indoor polution each day</p>
				</div>
				<p><span class="font20 bold">We inhale about 3,000 gallons of air every single day of our life</span><br>That's enough air to fill about 70 bathtubs. While humans can survive for a few days without water, or even months without food, none of us would last more than a few <i>minutes</i> without air. The air you breathe circulates throughout your entire body, supporting our internal organs, including the heart, lungs, kidneys and liver. So, when you breathe polluted air, you're introducing toxins into every cell of your body.</p>
				<p>When we think of air pollution, we often visualize big industrial plants bellowing out noxious plumes of smoke. What we <i>don't</i> think of is toxic pollution inside our <u>own</u> <u>homes</u>.</p>
				<p class="bold font18 center">You may think you are safe from these contaminants while inside, but nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
				<p>When you consider that Americans spend an average of 90 percent of their time indoors, it becomes clear why indoor air pollution is such a serious problem -  setting us up for a host of serious, and potentially deadly, health problems.</p>
				<p class="font20 bold">The SECRET SIGNS of indoor air pollution</p>
				<p>Many people often find themselves complaining of recurring nasal congestion, fatigue, or sneezing without realizing that these are common symptoms of exposure to indoor air pollution. Other symptoms include wheezing; irritability; itchy throat, nose, or skin; or dry or watery eyes; hives; coughing and even stomach aches.</p>
				<p>While these common ailments can be uncomfortable, they are mild compared to the potential long-term damage which can be caused by a toxic indoor environment. Indoor air pollution has been closely linked to many serious illnesses, including cancer, Alzheimers, and both heart <u>and</u> lung disease. According to the World Health Organization, our childrens' small, developing bodies are particularly vulnerable to the health problems caused or enhanced by indoor air pollution. </p>
				<p><span class="font20 bold">Common products you LOVE to use could be making your family sick.</span><br>While some pollutants found within your home originate from external sources (if the air is dirty <u>outside</u>, it's going to be dirty <u>inside</u>, as well), a large amount of indoor air pollution is also caused by products that we've inadvertently chosen to bring into our homes.  These include:</p>
				<ul class="normal-list">
					<li>Cleaning products</li>
					<li>Air fresheners</li>
					<li>Perfume and deodorants with synthetic fragrances</li>
					<li>Gas stoves, ovens and dryers</li>
					<li>Candles and fireplaces</li>
					<li>Smoking of any kind</li>
					<li>Burnt food</li>
					<li>Cooking on non-stick cookware</li>
					<li>Insect control chemicals</li>
				</ul>
				<p>There also exists <i>additional</i> dangerous pollutants we might <u>never</u> know about...until it's too late.  These include: </p>
				<ul class="normal-list">
					<li>Bacteria and Viruses – circulating throughout the air</li>
					<li>Air fresheners</li>
					<li>Hidden mold and mildew spores</li>
					<li>Pet dander</li>
					<li>Termites, cockroaches, and dust mites; including their deteriorating droppings</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="post-image-div">
					<img src="images/household_pollutants.jpg" alt="household pollutants" width="46%">
					<img src="images/spray1.png" alt="hair spray" width="37%">
					<p class="caption">Air pollutants are found in our in every day household products</p>
				</div>
				<p><span class="font20 bold">The "dirty secret" about home furnishings and building materials</span><br>House paint, carpeting and furniture, upholstery and flooring. Any or ALL of these common items in our home could be outgassing VOCs, or Volatile Organic Compounds ...right into our living space.</p>
				<p>And, this can continue – not for just a few weeks, or months – but for YEARS.</p>
				<p>One of the most dangerous of these chemical gasses is formaldehyde, a well-known human carcinogen. </p>
				<p>It's used in the manufacturing of building materials – like pressed wood products, fiber board and  plywood.  </p>
				<p>By the way...if you have furniture in your home that you bought before 2006, they are likely to be outgassing PBDE's...which are the same toxic chemicals used in flame retardant.</p>
				<p><span class="font20 bold">And that's just what's coming from INSIDE our homes.</span><br>The most common external sources of indoor air pollution include pollen, dust, and pollutants which come in through ventilation systems and through open doors and windows. But that's just the beginning. Many homes are contaminated with radon, which can come through the cracks in basements and crawl spaces. Pesticides can also be brought into the home on clothing and shoes, further contaminating the air inside the home.</p>
				<p>To make matters worse, the more that we keep our doors and windows sealed to keep OUT the <u>outdoor</u> pollutants, the more we trap these chemical gasses and contaminants <u>inside</u>.  Our homes are like giant Zip-loc bags, re-cycling the same polluted air over and over and over again – especially in cold winter months. </p>
				<p><span class="font20 bold">Start with these simple tips to de-toxify the air in your home</span><br>Make sure you take these simple steps to improve the air quality in your home:</p>
				<ul class="normal-list" >
					<li>Never let anyone smoke indoors</li>
					<li>Don't allow the humidity to exceed 50%</li>
					<li>Make sure gas burning appliances are fully vented to the outdoors</li>
					<li>Never store chemicals, paints or solvents in the basement or an attached garage</li>
					<li>Only buy "green" furnishings, upholstery, and carpeting that do not contain formaldehyde, and use low VOC paints which emit less toxins. </li>
				</ul>
				<p class="font20 bold red center">But, the <u>single most important</u> thing you can do to protect your family is having a High-Quality Air Purifier in your home</p>
				<p><span class="font20 bold">The 3 most important tips for choosing an air purifier</span><br>There are a number of different types of air filters available, and each one has its own benefits and drawbacks. For most homes, the 3 most important criteria to consider are:</p>
				 <ol class="normal-list">
				 	<li>The type of filtration being used</li>
				 	<li>The contaminants those filters are able to remove</li>
				 	<li>The CADR or performance rating (which also determines the room size it's able to filter effectively) </li>
				 </ol>
				<p>Let's quickly review each of these:</p>
				<p class="bold font20">What type of filter should you be looking for?</p>
				<p>HEPA and ULTRA-HEPA<br>Most people have heard of HEPA filters. HEPA is an acronym for High Efficiency Particulate Air, and these filters are designed to trap 99.97% of air-borne particles as small as .3 microns. <b>Ultra-HEPA</b> filters are considered are considered the top-of-the-line for home air purifiers, as they remove 99.95% as small as <u>.003 microns</u>. <b>That's 100 times more effective than an ordinary HEPA filter</b>.</p>
				<p>HEPA filters remove most particulate matter from the air including pet dander, mold, pollen, dust mite debris, bacteria and most germs and viruses. An Ultra HEPA filter will not only capture all this, but also the smallest viruses and the smallest air-borne particulates like smoke. The smaller the particles, the more dangerous they can be, as these microscopic toxins are absorbed more easily by our lungs and distributed throughout the body.</p>
				<p>While HEPA filtration is considered the gold-standard for particulate air filtration and Ultra HEPA the platinum standard, these filters still only do <u>half</u> the job of purifying the air in your home. </p>
				<p>To remove dangerous chemicals, gasses, fumes, aerosols and other VOCs from the air, you <u>also</u> need an air purifier with an: </p>
				<p><span class="font20">ACTIVATED CARBON FILTER</span><br>To <i>effectively</i> remove gasses, VOCs, and ozone, look for air purifiers that have a substantial activated carbon filter – at from ½ to 1 inch thick - filled with little pellets of activated carbon.</p>
				<p>In order to capture formaldehyde, which is very difficult to remove and extremely toxic – you also need a special type of mineral called potassium permanganate.  It's removes formaldehyde...and similar chemicals, which we call aldehydes, from the air. This mineral is normally added to the activated carbon pellets in your carbon filter.</p>
				<p><span class="font20 bold">Know Your CADR</span><br>Another important feature you should look for when buying a high-quality air purifier is its CADR rating. </p>
				<p>CADR stands for Clean Air Delivery Rate.</p>
				<p>What CADR tells you is how much of a particular contaminant is removed from the air within a specific period of time, and it creates an objective score that allows consumers to compare one air purifier to another.  </p>
				<p>There are 3 areas that CADR specifically measures: POLLEN, DUST and SMOKE. </p>
				<p>For best results, you should be looking for air purifiers which offer a CADR rating (not all do) and the number should be over 300. </p>
				<p><span class="font20 bold">Our Recommendation</span><br>The most common struggle consumers have when selecting an air purifier is finding one which can:</p>
				<ul class="normal-list" >
					<li>Effectively remove a broad spectrum of contaminants, both particulates and gases </li>
					<li>Are powerful enough to filter and clean all of the air in the room (at least 3x per hour)</li>
					<li>And can be purchased at an affordable price.  </li>
				</ul>
				<p>Often, you have to compromise. </p>
				<p>Air purifiers with these features can easily cost $1,000 or more and are generally only available online or at specialty retailers.</p>
				<p>That's why we were so excited to find recently a new product called that has all of these features – and more - at an extremely affordable price.  It's called the Air Doctor Pro.</p>
				<p><span class="font20 bold">100x More Effective than Ordinary Air Purifiers</span><br>What really impressed us about the Air Doctor Pro was how effective it was at cleaning the air in even large sized rooms.  To be honest, we at the Chopra Center have not seen another air purifier, designed for home use, that offers all of these high-end features, including:</p>
				<ul class="normal-list margin-list" >
					<li><span class="bold font18"></span>4 UNIQUE FILTERS</span> that collectively remove over 100x more contaminants than ordinary air filters, including smoke, mold, germs and viruses, pet dander, bacteria, pollen and odors.  It also removes VOCs, including gasses released from candles, paint, building materials, carpeting, cleaning products, hair spray, air freshener, ozone, formaldehyde and more. </li>
					<li><span class="bold font18">VERY HIGH CADR RATING</span> – With a CADR rating of 326, the Air Doctor can clean the air in a 900sq. ft. room 3x per hour. </li>
					<li><span class="bold font18">AUTO-MODE TAKES THE GUESSWORK</span> OUT OF CLEAN AIR – Air Doctor's Auto-Mode uses an Air Quality Sensor to assess the air quality in the room and immediately adjust to the correct level of filtration.</li>
					<li><span class="bold font18">AIR IONIZER REMOVES SMELLS AND ORDERS</span> for the cleanest, freshest -smelling air. This can be turned on or off, independent of the other filters.</li>
					<li><span class="bold font18">WHISPER-JET FAN</span> for quiet operation – 30% quieter than traditional air purifiers.</li>
					<li><span class="bold font18">SEALED SYSTEM</span> for HIGHEST EFFICIENCY – No unfiltered air escapes from the unit.  Many common air purifiers have loose fitting filters and are NOT sealed systems.  </li>
					<li><span class="bold font18">ADDITIONAL HIGH-END FEATURES</span> include a "change filter" alert, 24-hour adjustable timer and a DIM mode to turn off the lights on the unit when sleeping, </li>
