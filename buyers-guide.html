				<h1>How To Protect Your Family From Dangerous Water Contamination</h1>
				<p class="author">By <span class="author-title">Nicole Trelour, ND</span> - April 12, 2018</p>
				<div class="post-image-div border-bottom">
					<img src="images/runoff.png" alt="water running from tap" width="1000">
					<p class="caption">Dangerous runoff and harsh contaminates like this are making their way into Americans' drinking water systems every day.</p>
				</div>
				<p><span class="font20">Y</span>ou may unknowingly be exposing yourself and your loved ones to toxic, health damaging chemicals every time every time you turn on your tap.</p>
				<p>As a result, we are facing a public health crisis like never before... with as MILLIONS of Americans are ingesting poisonous chemicals in their drinking water, their coffee, tea, and even in the food they prepare. </p>
				<p>The worst part is that this problem isn't isolated to only one area of the United States. This a problem throughout ALL 50 STATES.</p>
				<p>The EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) is supposed to protect you, but despite having the power of government oversight and massive resources, the EPA enforces less than 8.3% of violations of the safe water standards. If you think living in a rural area means you're protected from this health hazard, then I have some very bad news... This health crisis is affecting sprawling cities, endless farmlands, and the coasts. Even the elite in Beverly Hills deal with EXCEEDINGLY DANGEROUS levels of chemicals in their drinking water.</p>
				<p>Knowledge is power. It is essential you know what's in your water, so I've compiled <b>years of research</b> about this man-made disaster, and its <b>dire effect</b> on our health.  <u>This guide will help you discover everything you need to know to make the <b>most informed</b> decision about finding the safest, most effective water treatment solution.</u></p>
				<h2 class="padtop30">WHAT'S THE PROBLEM, ANYWAY?</h2>
				<p><u>Right now</u>, there are countless <b>public</b> water systems that MILLIONS of Americans depend on for safe drinking water that are failing, broken, and <b>extremely contaminated</b>.</p>
				<p>The contamination comes from many different sources and you're supposed to be notified when your drinking water is no longer safe for consumption. To put it bluntly, the EPA largely ignores these issues over <u>90% of violations are <b>never</b> corrected</u>. </p>
				<p>To make matters worse, the standards have not been updated for over 30 years, so only a small number of harmful contaminants are ACTUALLY BEING MONITORED.  For example, drugs that include birth control hormones, blood pressure medicines, and pain killers are consistently found in drinking water, yet they are not even regulated or tested for these contaminants.  After all, if you don't know it's there, you don't have to fix it.</p>
				<p>EPA regulations <b><i>aren't even scratching the surface</i></b> of the thousands of health-destroying and cancer-causing <b><i>chemicals that have been proven to exist in our drinking water</i></b>. </p>
				<p>Just because your water looks clean or tastes "normal" does not make it safe.  If you and your family want to be safe and healthy, you must have an effective water treatment system</p>
				<h2 class="padtop30">10 CONTAMINANTS MOST LIKELY IN YOUR WATER</h2>
				<p>Modern technology has created a false sense of comfort across the nation. Unfortunately, <b>industrialization, pollution, and a plethora of man-made chemicals</b> all used in the name of profit and protected by special interest groups have knowingly introduced incredibly <b>dangerous toxins</b> into our water.</p>

				<p>Keep in mind these are just 10 of the contaminants mostly commonly found in our water systems across the country.  While EPA has identified 7,500 contaminants in municipal tap water across the country that are considered to be significant health risks, the water is not monitored or tested for a vast majority of these!</p>
				<h2 class="padtop30 center">WHAT <u>NOT TO DO</u> WHEN BUYING A WATER FILTRATION SYSTEM</h2>
				<p><b>It's difficult to know where to start when it comes to filtered water</b>, and many consumers report <b>regretting</b> their first water filter purchase. With this in mind, we included this section to help you <b>learn from and avoid their <u>COSTLY</u> mistakes:</b></p>
				<p>FORGETTING TO RESEARCH<br>You may believe that all water filter systems are the same.  This is <u>not</u> the case. Most shoppers purchase a cheap plastic pitcher filter believing that this protects their families.  Unfortunately, almost all pitcher filters are <b>ineffective</b>, removing not even a handful of contaminants.  These pitcher filters are designed <b>mainly for taste</b>. <b>Under-the-counter systems</b> are more effective but are very expensive, requiring professional installation and constant expensive maintenance you should <b>avoid</b> at all costs. </p>
				<p>RELYING SOELY ON WEB SEARCH REVIEWS<br>Millions of Americans rely on reviews from search engines before purchasing their products, but most don't realize that <b>up to 80% are written by opportunistic competitors</b>. Some shady individuals even extort companies with negative reviews for a quick buck, regardless of whether or not they've tried the product. <b>Risking your health</b> with false reviews isn't worth it when it comes to keeping your family safe.</p>
				<p>PRIORITIZING COST OVER QUALITY<br>While you may believe that a pitcher water purifier is inexpensive, over time the cost of replacement filters quickly adds up - while likely removing only two of the ten contaminants listed in our "Top Ten" list.  Just look at the countless examples of confusing guarantees that may seem like a good deal but which, ultimately, only <b>hurt your wallet</b>. It's extremely important to find a water treatment system with the qualities listed below to protect you and your family properly.</p>
				<h2 class="padtop30 center">THE QUALITIES OF A GOOD WATER FILTRATION SYSTEM</h2>
				<p>Based on research and feedback from industry experts, these are the MUST HAVES in an <b>exceptional</b> water filtration system:</p>
				<p><img src="images/green-check.png" alt=""> REVERSE OSMOSIS<br>Reverse Osmosis is an extremely effective process in which pressurized water is pushed through a membrane-filter to remove amazingly small and even atom-sized contaminants down to almost undetectable amounts. Previously only found in only expensive under-the-counter filtration systems, this is considered the "gold standard" of water filtration.</p>
				<p><img src="images/green-check.png" alt=""> MULTIPLE STAGE FILTERING<br>Multiple stage filtering is the only way you can guarantee the water that you and your family consumes not only tastes great but is also safe to drink. Make sure your unit has a carbon block pre-filter (for taste and simple contaminants) and a VOC carbon block post filter (for complex organic contaminants), as well as the Reverse Osmosis filter mentioned above. When it comes to your health, you never want to rely on just one fail-safe. </p>
				<p><img src="images/green-check.png" alt=""> CERTIFIED TO NSF STANDARDS<br>It is critical that the water purifier you purchase is certified to NSF (National Sanitation Foundation) Standards. NSF is a global public health and safety organization and is the authority for water filter standards. The highly-coveted NSF certification guarantees the water filter system is of the highest quality and meets 7 highly stringent and extremely important conditions:</p>
				<ol class="number-list">
					<li>Application and information submission</li>
					<li>Product evaluation</li>
					<li>Product testing in lab</li>
					<li>Manufacturing facility inspection, product confirmation, and product sampling</li>
					<li>Test results review and acceptance</li>
					<li>Contract signature and product listing</li>
					<li>Annual plant inspection and retesting</li>
				</ol>
				<p>For maximum protection, the filter system should be tested to NSF standards covering taste (#42), organic contaminants (#53), inorganic contaminants (#58), and emerging contaminants such as drug residue (#401).  It's frightening to realize that the best-selling pitcher purifier is certified only under NSF standards #42 and #53 and can remove no more than 6 chemicals.</p>
				<p><img src="images/green-check.png" alt=""> EASY TO USE<br>While Reverse Osmosis and Multiple Stage Filtering are great, it doesn't necessarily mean that systems with these features are easy to use. You should avoid a system that requires exhaustive installation and expensive, time-consuming maintenance. Your time should be spent enjoying crisp, clean water. No one should have to spend hours under their sink installing a new and expensive filtering system.</p>
				<h2 class="padtop30 center">THE 3 GUARANTEES OF A HIGH-QUALITY WATER FILTRATION SYSTEM</h2>
				<p><span class="uppercase">1. it Is certified to remove at least 15 times more contaminants than water pitcher filters</span><br>The best-selling pitcher filters typically remove only 5 commonly found but largely unimportant contaminants.  However, the most effective water purification system tested by experts was certified to remove over 74 chemicals to the NSF standards mentioned earlier.  That's over 15 times the number of contaminants filtered by pitcher filters!  When you find a system that also removes contaminants which are tasteless, odorless, and often go completely unmonitored, you will be guaranteed that these toxins can no longer wreak enormous havoc on the health and safety of your family.  </p>
				<p>2. IT HAS DEMONSTRABLE RESULTS<br>The only way to know how well a water filtration system works is to see it in action. Most water filtration systems avoid showing you <b><i>true stress tests</i></b> of their products, because they are scared to fail! You need to see a dramatic filtration example to be sure it can TRULY be effective.</p>
				<p>3. IT IS RECOMMENDED BY HEALTH AND WELLNESS EXPERTS<br>We rely on health experts for our overall well-being, so why wouldn't we use a water filtration system they recommend for your overall health? Most companies' water filtration systems don't guarantee your water's overall safety or the safety of the system they want you to trust.</p>

				<h2>THE BOTTOM LINE</h2>
				<p>In my opinion, and after countless hours of expert-backed research and examination, <b>Aquatru Water System</b> is by far the most <b>efficient, cost effective,</b> and <b>convenient</b> water filtration system available. It works right out of the box without plumbing or installation.  It requires no expensive service or maintenance.  Plus, due to its certification to <b>NSF standards</b> #42, #53, #58, and #401 and its <b>innovative 4-step filtration process</b>, it can truly guarantee the safety of you and your family.  This is the only product I could find that has been <b><i>endorsed by multiple highly-respected medical doctors</i></b> across many specialties. One nationally-known doctor and NY Times best seller raved about the product, claiming that "AquaTru has created the world's most powerful water filter..." Reviewers absolutely <b>love</b> this affordable, easy-to-use counter-top water filtration system.</p>
